    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <div class="p">A person's life has to be anchored on a supreme power which needs to be slowly developed with guidance, directions and good models. It is integrated in the routine programme of the homes.</div>
    <div class="p">Children get ample opportunities to interact with friends, benefactors, volunteers from India and abroad which enhances the process of socialization. The presence of loving and caring staff their availability and commitment give children emotional
        security and space to express their emotions in a healthy way.</div>
    <div class="p">One of the beautiful things about the young children is that they absorb themselves totally in the present moment in what ever they are doing. Spend time with children; learn more about laughter, spontaneity, curiosity, acceptance, resilience, trust
        and determination. </div>
    <h2>Social Awareness Programmes</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <div class="p">We offer ecological and social awareness programmes for the NGO groups and staff members of various organizations like schools. Students of colleges and schools also are targeted. These programmes help to create in the beneficiaries a sense of social
        commitment and a concern for creation. </div>
    <div class="p">Many schools and colleges conduct activities and programmes for the children and connect with them. They organize a one-day activity which include games, learnings and meals. We organise School Annual Days, Women's Day, Self-help Group Meetings.</div>

        and can live in our society and become good leaders of their own world thereby creating value based communities abd families around them.</div>
