<!--hr class="line"-->
<p class="sec-description">We have come up with a motto <b>"Committed to Responsible well-being"</b> striving to provide members of the public with a wide range of welfare services, including social security, rural development and Child Welfare services. </p>
<p class="sec-description">Our vision is to effectively work towards providing a facilitative environment for the growth and development of orphaned and destitute children and to work towards their integration in the main stream of society by providing shelter, food, clothing,
    education and accommodating them in the home with a foster mother or parents who will provide them a sense of security and affection</p>

<h2 class="heading">Philosophy</h2>
<hr class="line">
<br>
<p class="sec-description">A person's life has to be anchored on a supreme power which needs to be slowly developed with guidance, directions and good models. It is integrated in the routine programme of the homes.</p>
<p class="sec-description">Children get ample opportunities to interact with friends, benefactors, volunteers from India and abroad which enhances the process of socialization. The presence of loving and caring staff their availability and commitment give children emotional security
    and space to express their emotions in a healthy way.</p>
<p class="sec-description">One of the beautiful things about the young children is that they absorb themselves totally in the present moment in what ever they are doing. Spend time with children; learn more about laughter, spontaneity, curiosity, acceptance, resilience, trust and
    determination. </p>
<h2 class="heading">Social Awareness Programmes</h2>
<hr class="line">
<br>
<p class="sec-description">We offer ecological and social awareness programmes for the NGO groups and staff members of various organizations like schools. Students of colleges and schools also are targeted. These programmes help to create in the beneficiaries a sense of social
    commitment and a concern for creation. </p>
<p class="sec-description">Many schools and colleges conduct activities and programmes for the children and connect with them. They organize a one-day activity which include games, learnings and meals. We organise School Annual Days, Women's Day, Self-help Group Meetings.</p>

    and can live in our society and become good leaders of their own world thereby creating value based communities abd families around them.</p>
